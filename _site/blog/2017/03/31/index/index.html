<h2 id="the-briefing">The Briefing</h2>

<p>You arrive at an upscale casino in Las Vegas during the best night of excitement on the strip: the famous Elvis impersonator. As you show up, you’re briefed by the local police on the situation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone was assembled at the bar, waiting for the show to begin.</p>

  <p>As the show starts, a gun shot echoes throughout the bar. The curtain comes up, Elvis goes down, dead. The casino’s bar doors slam shut and everyone in the bar is a suspect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Las Vegas Police Department (LVPD) has seen fit to challenge its two best teams with this task. You are assignted to determine:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Who is the murderer?</li>
  <li>Why did the murderer kill Elvis?</li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout the night you will be asked a to answer questions and to complete challenges to gain information. You must piece these together to determine who is the murderer. Local police has narrowed it down to four suspects:</p>

<h2 id="1-the-singing-teacher">1. The Singing Teacher</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have been coaching Elvis with his voice for the last couple of months, seeing him skyrocket with succes. We do private lessons at my studio and I come here every weekend to critique him and watch him perform.</p>

  <p>I am married to my wife, who’s not at the casino tonight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="2-the-gun-nut">2. The Gun Nut</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I own a lot of guns, so what? I’m just here with my wife tonight and we were hoping to enjoy a good Elvis impersonation and exercise our 2nd amendment rights to bear arms.</p>

  <p><strong>Cop:</strong> I heard from the other guests that you were having an argument with Elvis before the show?</p>

  <p>Yeah, I was disappointed to see it was him tonight as he’s pretty terrible. I was trying to scare him off hoping the Casino would hire a replacement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="3-the-gigolo">3. The Gigolo</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>True, I mostly <em>do</em> high-class clients and celibrities, but what has that got to do with anything? I can’t discuss client-relations, that’d ruin my reputation!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="4-the-gladiator-actor">4. The Gladiator Actor</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elvis and I used to be best friends, you know! I’d give the guests a warm welcome and he’d seal the deal at the end of the night. Alas, no more! I might’ve helped myself to an extra drink or two on the house, but if that bastard hadn’t ratted on me noone would have cared.</p>

  <p><strong>Cop:</strong> I have a source telling me that you said you were going to “Stab Elvis in the back, like Brutus stabbed Caesar.”</p>

  <p>Damn it Crystal, I trusted you! That’s the name of the stripper-source that told you, isn’t it? I was just drunk and frustrated, that’s all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>May the odds be ever in your favour.</p>
